This app was created during my studies of web development and its published as MERN stack app on heroku: philomessenger.herokuapp.com

Its my firt web app as a result of my self-studies and its still under progresss. Because it grew organically, the code on every file does not show the same level of developing skills i already reached. By time i will work through the whole code and bring it to one level.

About this app:

It was actually created for my personal use to write and publish texts, but opened up for more users to do the same. But why a new online text editor? My intention is to write dialogues in the form of a group chat like you know from modern messengers. I haven't found the right one for myself, so i decided to invent my own one and teach myself the same time about web development.
