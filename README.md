Note: To deploy this app on heroku, the package.json file has to be outside of the server folder.

Its a MERN stack app, means I use MongoDB as my database, express as middleware, React as framework library and node.js as runtime environment for javascript. Additionally I use Redux for state management, firebase for authorization, react-bootstrap for styling some parts (e.g. for forms) and react hooks.

Have a look at the main components 'chat', 'drafts' and 'publish' in 'client/src/main/' but also the state management in 'client/src/redux'.

This is a demoversion for a free online text editor for writing texts/dialogues in form of a chat and same time a platform to publish those texts. I always wanted to write down my own philosophical ideas, but couldn't find the right way to bring them on paper. Finally in 2019 I thought about writing in form of dialogues to express my thoughts. So I decided to create my own online text editor and a plattform to publish the chats.

At the beginning of 2020 I started to teach myself programming to become a web developer and building this app. This MERN stack single page application 
is my first project I have launched. I am using this one as a part of my job applications.

I do not follow any commercial purposes with this app.
